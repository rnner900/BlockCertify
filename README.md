## About
This DApp is a Certification System that uses a Blockchain for storing Certificates and Courses. There are two roles: issuer, participant. 

As an issuer you can create courses. The issuer can add and remove participants addresses to the course. After that the course owner can generate certificates for a selection of the course participants. These certificates are stored in a ethereum block chain as transactions of a smart contract. 
As a participant the application displays courses he participates and certificates he received. 
Both roles log in with metamask with the address and private Key for the (local) blockchain. 
You can learn more about this project by reading the documentation.
