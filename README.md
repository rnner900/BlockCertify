## About
Certification System that uses a Blockchain. There are two roles: issuer, participant. As an issuer you can create courses. The issuer can add and remove participants addresses to the course. After that the course owner can generate certificates for a selection of the course participants. These certificates are stored in a ethereum block chain.
